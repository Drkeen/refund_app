Reason for COE:

Medical reasons
The student’s request is supported by a medical certificate indicating multiple medical conditions that affect her ability to cope with studying and placement, making medical reasons the most appropriate category.

Special Circumstances eligibility:

Beyond control: MET – The medical conditions cited (ASD, ADHD, anxiety, etc.) are inherent health issues beyond the student’s control.
After start of study/census: NOT CLEAR – The certificate is dated 12/11/2025, which is after the course commencement (14/07/2025), but it is unclear when the conditions began to impact the student’s ability to study or if the full impact was only realized after the start date.
Unreasonable to complete: MET – The medical certificate explicitly states the student is unfit to complete the TAFE course, indicating it is unreasonable for her to continue within the current timeframe.

Documentation assessment:

Independence of documentation: The medical certificate is from a registered medical practitioner, independent and appropriate.
Adequacy of detail: The certificate lists specific medical conditions and states the student is unfit to complete the course, but lacks detailed information on when symptoms worsened or how the conditions specifically impacted study timelines.
Noted gaps/limitations: The certificate does not specify when the conditions began to affect study or when it became apparent the student could not continue; no detailed explanation of impact on assessments or attendance.

Timeline of events:

14/07/2025 – Course (CHC33021 - Certificate III in Individual Support Disability) commences (EASD).
12/11/2025 – Medical certificate issued by Dr. Sune Kilian confirming medical conditions and unfitness to complete course.

Impact on study (summary):

• The student’s medical conditions have impaired her ability to cope with both studying and placement requirements.
• She is currently unable to attend or fully engage with classes and placement activities.
• The conditions have likely affected her capacity to submit assessments or meet course timelines.
• The medical certificate indicates she is unfit to complete the course, suggesting significant impact on study continuation.
