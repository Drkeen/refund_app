Withdrawal from Studies

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing on behalf of Georgie Vella, who is currently employed with Top Health Doctors. This letter serves as a formal statement in support of their application to withdraw from their current studies at Tafe Queensland South Bank.

Georgie has been a valued member of our team since March this year and until recently, they were working an average of 15–20 hours per week. Due to an unexpected staff shortage within our organisation, we have had to increase their working hours to 25–38 hrs per week to ensure continued support of operations.

This change in workload has significantly impacted Georgie’s ability to balance work and academic commitments. We understand that this decision to withdraw from studies has not been made lightly, and we fully support them in prioritising their professional responsibilities during this challenging period. Should you require any further information or clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me directly.

Sincerely,

Jen Dick
Practice Manager
